# PSIGate PHP API

PHP implementation of PSIGate XML Messenger and Account Manager API.

> __WARNING (2017-10-23)__
>
> Due to change in URL structure of API gateway, an incompatibility issue may arise when
> update to the most recent `dev-master` version from prior to 2017-10-23 one.
> Version history is introduced to address the issue (my mistake not to introduce it right away).
> If you want to use old version, i.e. not to introduce changes in your current code, change `dev-master`
> to `0.9` in your composer file. To avoid potential future compatibility, change `dev-master`
> to the most relevant current release.
 
## General Information

The library is a wrapper around [PSIGate XML API](http://psigate.com/pages/techsupport.asp) making input and result array structures reflect
structure of XML documents PSIGate gateway expects. Refer to original PSIGate documentation to understand what parameters to set and what
result values to expect.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the library is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```json
{
    "require": {
        "propa/psigate": "~1"
    }
}
```

## Handling Exceptions

If an error occurs during request processing, an exception is thrown. Exception code is initialized with corresponding
PSIGate API error code (RPA-0002, RIV-0019 etc.) and exception message with corresponding error message, refer to PSIGate
API documentation for the full list of error codes and associated messages.

There are several PHP API specific errors related to unexpected response format, cURL and other situations, their exception codes are
prefixed with PAPI and CURL (e.g. PAPI-0001, PAPI-0002, CURL-0001, CURL-0006 etc).

Be aware that if exception is not thrown, it doesn't mean the operation was successful in general terms. E.g. *AMMessenger::chargeImmediate()*
returns *Invoice* structure in result even though tranasaction is declined by processing gateway and credit card is not debited. There is
*Messenger::analyseTransactionResult()* method which can be used for checking if data structure contains error information. 

## XML Messenger (XMLMessenger)

XML Messenger allows to process real-time credit card transactions.

### Basic usage

```php
<?php
$xmlm = new \PSIGate\XMLMessenger('https://realtimestaging.psigate.com/xml', 'teststore', 'psigate1234');
try {
    $result = $xmlm->order(array(
        'Subtotal' => '10.00',
        'PaymentType' => 'CC',
        'CardAction' => '0',
        'CardNumber' => '4111111111111111',
        'CardExpMonth' => '02',
        'CardExpYear' => '16',
        'CardIDNumber' => '1234',
        'Item' => array(
            array(
                'ItemID' => 'PSI-BOOK',
                'ItemDescription' => 'XML Interface Doc',
                'ItemQty' => '1',
                'ItemPrice' => '10.00',
                'Option' => array(
                    'Type' => 'Electronic',
                    'File' => 'xml.doc',
                ),
            ),
            array(
                'ItemID' => 'COUPON',
                'ItemDescription' => '10% discount',
                'ItemQty' => '1',
                'ItemPrice' => '-2.00',
            ),
        ),
    ));
    
    // analyze transaction result ...
    
} catch (\PSIGate\Exception $e) {
    // handle transaction error ...
}
```

## Account Manager (AMMessenger)

Account Manager Service allows to register customer payment accounts, store
customer payment information for future recurring or real-time authorization,
track customersâ€™ recurring or real-time transaction activity in the form of invoices.

### Basic usage

```php
<?php
$amm = new \PSIGate\AMMessenger('https://accountsstaging.psigate.com/xml', '1000001', 'teststore', 'testpass');
try {
    // register a new account
    $accountResult = $amm->accountRegister(array(
        'Name' => 'John Smith Jr.',
        'Company' => 'PSiGate Inc.',
        'Address1' => '145 King St.',
        'Address2' => '2300',
        'City' => 'Toronto',
        'Province' => 'Ontario',
        'Postalcode' => 'M5H 1J8',
        'Country' => 'Canada',
        'Phone' => '1-905-123-4567',
        'Fax' => '1-905-123-4568',
        'Email' => 'support@psigate.com',
        'Comments' => 'No Comment Today',
        'CardInfo' => array(
            'CardHolder' => 'John Smith',
            'CardNumber' => '4005550000000019',
            'CardExpMonth' => '08',
            'CardExpYear' => '11',
        ),
    ));
    
    // retrieve newly assigned account id
    $accountId = $accountResult['AccountID'];
    $cardSerialNo = $accountResult['CardInfo']['SerialNo'];
    
    // register a charge
    $chargeResult = $amm->chargeRegister(array(
        'StoreID' => 'teststore',
        'AccountID' => $accountId,
        'SerialNo' => $cardSerialNo,
        'RBName' => 'Monthly Payment',
        'Interval' => 'M',
        'RBTrigger' => '12',
        'EndDate' => '2011.12.31',
        'ItemInfo' => array(
            'ProductID' => 'NEWSPAPER',
            'Description' => 'TORONTO STAR',
            'Quantity' => '1',
            'Price' => '25',
            'Tax1' => '2',
            'Tax2' => '1.25',
        ),
    ));
    
    // retrieve newly created charge id
    $chargeId = $chargeResult['RBCID'];
    
    // disable a charge
    $amm->chargeDisable($chargeId);
    
    // ...
    
} catch (\PSIGate\Exception $e) {
    // handle error ...
}
```

### Return Values

Return values of AMMessenger methods can be split into such groups:

1. Summary actions (*accountSummary*, *invoiceSummary* etc.).
These can return empty result (NULL), single record (one dimentional array) or multiple records (array of arrays). Since it is unknown upfront
how many results specified filter rules will yeild, calling script must be flexible in handling possible return structures.
2. Details actions (*accountDetails*, *chargeDetails* etc.).
These return either empty result (NULL), if record with specified ID is not found, or single record.
3. Actions which create a record in PSIGate database (*accountRegister*, *accountCardAdd*, *chargeRegister* etc.)
These return a record created during the process, usually used by calling script to aquire fields generated by PSIGate (record ID, transaction status etc.)
4. Actions which update or delete already existing record (*accountUpdate*, *templateDisable*, *chargeDelete*, *emailReportDelete* etc.).
These return PSIGate success code for corresponding operation, since success code for each action type doesn't change, this return value
is not much useful to calling script and usually can be ignored.

### Known Issues (2013-11-21)

There are inconsitencies between Account Manager API documentation v1.1.08 and actual API behavior.
Since PHP API is a simple intermediary interface, the source of the issues is PSIGate server itself.

1.  Not all return codes and messages are documented (e.g. "EMR-0099 Immediate email report has been sent successfully.").
2.  Some methods return different success code from what could be assumed from documentation, e.g. account card update
    action (AMA12) returns "RPA-0022 Update Account action completed successfully." though there is more specific
    "RPA-0025 Update Card action completed successfully." listed.
3.  Summary actions do not support all filters specified in documentation.
4.  Summary actions do not have required filters, though documentation may list some as such.
5.  Register actions return generated ID if not specified explicitly except for "CTL01 Register template"
    which returns empty value for TemplateID though subsequent requests for details show that TemplateID was generated.
6.  In charge template related actions, except for template item add (CTL11), trigger date must be specified with Trigger,
    not with RBTrigger as suggested by documentation.
7.  Delete, enable, disable template, and delete, enable and disable template item actions (CTL04, CTL08, CTL09,
    and CTL14, CTL18, CTL19 respectively) expect template id to be 
    supplied with RBCID condition, not with TemplateID as suggested by documentation.
8.  Item Add actions are not satisfied with holder id only (RBCID or TemplateID) since PSIGate runs validation
    for condition equivalent elements and thus required fields (as defined in holder register action) must be
    supplied even though holder id would be enough.
9.  Register charge action (RBC01) needs required fields set regardless of the fact that charge is created based on
    template with the same ones defined.
10. Immediate charge action (RBC99) in Invoice response element returns RBCID value twice.
